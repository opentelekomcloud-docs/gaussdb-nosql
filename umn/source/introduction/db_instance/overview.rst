Overview
========

A DB instance is the minimum management unit and an independently running database. A DB instance can contain multiple user-created databases, and you can access it using the same tools and applications that you use with a stand-alone DB instance.

The cloud database supports multiple instance types to meet different compute and storage requirements. Each instance type provides various flavors with different vCPU and memory configurations for you to select.

-  For details about instance types, see :ref:`Compatible APIs and Versions <nosql_01_0007>`.
-  For details about all instance statuses in a lifecycle, see :ref:`DB Instance Status <nosql_01_0008>`.
-  For details about instance specifications, see :ref:`DB Instance Specifications <nosql_01_0006>`.
